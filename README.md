## Introduction
This is the repository for HIPS-THOMAS, a Docker-based pipeline for accurate segmentation of the Thalamus and several other sub-cortical nuclei using the THOMAS segmentation program. HIPS-THOMAS processes both WMn (white matter nulled) and T1w (SPGR,MPRAGE) images but performs much better than THOMAS for T1w data as it synthesizes WMn-like images from T1 prior to running THOMAS.

The HIPS-THOMAS workflow is illustrated here:

## Features
This container-based version builds a Docker container for THOMAS which has a number of new features:
1. It is based on Python 3.12 and uses a minimal number of modules from FSL, making it much smaller than previous versions (16G vs 41G).
2. It now also segments the basal ganglia, claustrum, and red nucleus!!
3. It generates a quality control file called `stlabels_LR.png` and a composite label file with contiguous labels (for deep learning training) called `stlabels_LR.nii.gz`. Both files are produced at the top level of output results: parallel with the `left` and `right` directories.

#### Differences from previous versions:
1. The main script is now Bash shell based and is called `hipsthomas.sh`,
2. `thomas` and `thomasfull` now have both thalami and other deep grey structures,
3. `nuclei_vols.txt` has volumes of both thalami and other deep grey structures,
4. The right side processing uses the same crop as the left side, so it is faster and you can combine L and R easily (e.g., using fslmaths).


## Running
To run HIPS-THOMAS, each anatomical file should be in a separate directory and the results are placed in that same directory. You launch the container from the command line by running a Docker command inside the directory containing the input image file.

For example, given an input image 'T1.nii.gz', in the current working directory, the container would be run by the following command:
```
docker run -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} --user $(id -u):$(id -g) --rm -t anagrammarian/thomas3 bash -c "hipsthomas.sh -i T1.nii.gz -t1"
```

The `-t1` option causes HIPS processing to be done before running THOMAS. HIPS synthesizes WMn-MPRAGE like images from T1 data, improving thalamic contrast and also allowing standard THOMAS to be run (which then uses CC metric for nonlinear registration and joint fusion). This is not possible with direct T1 as the contrast is different from the template, thus forcing MI metric (which is less accurate) and majority voting for label fusion (which is also suboptimal).

THOMAS processing works even better on WMn MPRAGE (FGATIR) data, due to the better intra-thalamic contrast. In the following example, WMn.nii.gz is the white matter nulled MPRAGE file (or FGATIR if you will/must).
```
docker run -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} --user $(id -u):$(id -g) --rm -t anagrammarian/thomas3 bash -c "hipsthomas.sh -i WMn.nii.gz"
```

Note the lack of `-t1` option, as HIPS conversion is not needed for this type of image.


### Apptainer (nee Singularity):

You can directly pull the Docker container image from dockerhub and save it as an Apptainer (Singularity) '.sif' file.

First, install Apptainer using the instructions found here https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html. Once installed, run:
```
apptainer pull thomas3.sif docker://anagrammarian/thomas3
```

The Apptainer instantiation is a little bit different than Docker. For example, to run on a T1 image, call Apptainer like this:
```
apptainer run -B ${PWD}:${PWD} -W ${PWD} -u --cleanenv /path/to/thomas3.sif bash -c "hipsthomas.sh -i T1.nii.gz -t1"
```

For a WMn/FGATIR image run the following:
```
apptainer run -B ${PWD}:${PWD} -W ${PWD} -u --cleanenv path/to/thomas3.sif bash -c "hipsthomas.sh -i WMn.nii.gz"
```

>[!NOTE]
>That the `thomas3.sif` container can be saved and run from anywhere (illustrated in the above example by 'path/to/thomas3.sif'). For example, if you save the container in your home bin directory (~/bin), you would specify the path as `/home/yourusername/bin/thomas3.sif`

## Outputs
The directories named **left** and **right** contain the outputs, which include:
- individual label files (e.g. 2-AV.nii.gz for anteroventral and so on)
- **thomas.nii.gz**: a single file with all labels fused, and
- **thomasfull.nii.gz**: which is the same size as the input file (i.e. full size as opposed to **thomas.nii.gz** which is cropped).
-  **nucVols.txt**: contains the nuclei volumes.
-  **regn.nii.gz**: is the custom template registered to the input image. This file is critical for debugging. Make sure this file and crop_inputfilename are well aligned. Note that this is for left side. The right regn.nii.gz needs to be swapped LR before it will align to crop_inputfilename. 
-  **CustomAtlas.ctbl**: is a color table, provided for visualization.
-  **temp** and **tempr**: are directories containing intermediate results used for advanced debugging and can be deleted to save space.
